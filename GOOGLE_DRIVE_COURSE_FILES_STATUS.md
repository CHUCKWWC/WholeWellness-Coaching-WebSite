## Current Status: DEMO MODE

### Why Demo Mode?
The system is currently running in demo mode because Google Drive API credentials are not configured. This provides:

1. **Immediate Testing**: Full functionality without waiting for API setup
2. **User Experience Preview**: Shows exactly how the integration will work
3. **Development Continuity**: Allows continued development without blocking

### Demo Files Available
- Advanced Wellness Coaching - Module 1.pdf
- Coaching Techniques Video Tutorial.mp4
- Client Assessment Worksheet.docx
- Nutrition Planning Template.xlsx
- Behavior Change Strategies Presentation.pptx
- Course Resources and References.pdf

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue with Demo
- Test the current functionality
- Verify user interface and experience
- Ensure all features work as expected

### Option 2: Enable Real Google Drive
- Provide Google Drive API credentials
- Connect to actual folder: `1G8F_pu26GDIYg2hAmSxjJ2P1bvIL4pya`
- Access real course files and documents

## Technical Details

### File Structure in Code
```javascript
// Each course includes:
syllabus: {
  driveFolder: "1G8F_pu26GDIYg2hAmSxjJ2P1bvIL4pya",
  modules: [
    { title: "Module Name", duration: hours }
  ]
}
```

### Fallback System
- Primary: Google Drive API (when credentials provided)
- Fallback: Demo service (immediate functionality)
- Automatic detection and switching between modes

The course files are configured and ready - the system just needs Google Drive API credentials to access the real folder content at `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G8F_pu26GDIYg2hAmSxjJ2P1bvIL4pya`.
