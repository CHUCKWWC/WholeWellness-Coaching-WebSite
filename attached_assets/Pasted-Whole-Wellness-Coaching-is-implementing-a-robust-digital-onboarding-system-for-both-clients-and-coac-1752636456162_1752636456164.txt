Whole Wellness Coaching is implementing a robust digital onboarding system for both clients and coaches. The goal is to automate intake, streamline communications, and centralize resources, using best-in-class SaaS solutions. Below is a breakdown tailored for a software engineer, focusing on workflows, system requirements, and integration points.

Client Onboarding Workflow
1. Initial Contact & Discovery

A client schedules a discovery call via an online booking system (e.g., embedded calendar widget).

Purpose: Qualify leads, clarify service offerings, capture goals/expectations.

2. Automated Welcome Packet

Upon sign-up, the system auto-sends digital forms:

Contracts and waivers (e-signature required)

Health history questionnaire

Program guide and privacy policy

3. Personalized Assessment

Clients complete an intake tool (e.g., “Wheel of Life”) via a web form—responses stored to their profile.

4. Scheduling & Communication

The client gains portal access:

Book sessions (calendar integration, e.g., Google Calendar API)

Secure asynchronous messaging with their coach

Automated session reminders (email/SMS APIs)

5. Progress Tracking

Track goals, actions, and session notes (client and coach access).

Data visualization and progress summaries (simple dashboards or timeline views).

Coach Onboarding Workflow
1. Digital Application & Vetting

Coaches complete an online application:

Credential verification

Initial interview scheduling

Document upload (e.g., certifications)

2. Digital Orientation & Training

On acceptance, coaches access a training portal:

Onboarding docs, SOPs

Role-specific video modules, quizzes

3. Resource Library & Peer Network

Single sign-on access to shared resources, templates, and continued education

Internal community connection (forum/slack/group chat integration)

Integration & Implementation Steps
Platform Selection

Automation

Configure workflows: automatic emails on sign-up, reminders, follow-ups.

Use webhooks for calendar and messaging events.

Portal Customization

Set up role-based dashboards for clients/coaches.

Attach resources, enable scheduling, and progress tracking features.

Feedback Loops

After onboarding, automate client/coach feedback collection (post-onboarding surveys with analytics).

Best Practices
Provide step-by-step onboarding flows (automated but customizable per user).

Centralize all communication, scheduling, and documentation in one portal for both user types.

Ensure HIPAA-compliant data storage and messaging for privacy.

Regularly update training resources and intake forms via the admin CMS.

Use analytics to iterate and improve onboarding flows based on user feedback.

Summary
For a software engineer, the goal is to deliver a user-centric, scalable onboarding system using specialized SaaS platforms for the wellness coaching market. The workflow centers around automating repetitive tasks, ensuring secure document management, and providing seamless communications—all while maintaining flexibility for continuous process improvement.
