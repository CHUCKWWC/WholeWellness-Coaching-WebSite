# Critical Security Fix - Role-Based Access Control

## Security Vulnerability Resolved
**Issue**: Member accounts could access coach-only resources including certification courses, profile management, banking information, and client data.

**Risk Level**: HIGH - Unauthorized access to sensitive coach data and functionality

## Security Implementation

### 1. Role-Based Authorization Middleware
- Added `requireCoachRole` middleware in `server/auth.ts`
- Validates JWT token AND checks user role = 'coach'
- Returns 403 "Coach access required" for non-coach users

### 2. Protected Endpoints Secured
All coach endpoints now require coach role:
- `/api/coach/certification-progress` 
- `/api/coach/start-module`
- `/api/coach/submit-quiz`
- `/api/coach/profile` (GET/POST)
- `/api/coach/credentials` (GET/POST)
- `/api/coach/banking` (GET/POST)
- `/api/coach/availability`
- `/api/coach/my-enrollments`
- `/api/coach/my-certificates`

### 3. Enhanced JWT Token
- Updated token generation to include complete user context
- Token contains: id, email, firstName, lastName, role, membershipLevel, isActive
- Ensures accurate role validation throughout system

## Testing Results

### Security Tests Passed ✅
```bash
# Member attempting coach access (BLOCKED)
GET /api/coach/certification-progress -> 403 "Coach access required"
GET /api/coach/profile -> 403 "Coach access required"  
GET /api/coach/banking -> 403 "Coach access required"

# Coach with proper role (ALLOWED)
GET /api/coach/certification-progress -> 200 OK
GET /api/coach/profile -> 200 OK
```

## Test Accounts Created
- **Coach**: coachchuck@wwctest.com (role: coach)
- **Member**: memberchuck@wwctest.com (role: user)
- **Password**: chucknice1

## Security Status: RESOLVED ✅
- Role-based access control fully implemented
- All coach resources properly protected  
- Member accounts cannot access restricted areas
- System maintains security while preserving functionality

## JWT Token Analysis
- **Before Role Update**: `{"role": "user"}` - Blocked from coach resources ✅
- **After Role Promotion**: User must re-login to get updated JWT token
- **Security Verification**: 403 "Coach access required" for unauthorized users ✅

## Production Readiness
- Enhanced security middleware operational
- HTTPS OAuth configuration maintained  
- All certification features working with proper authorization
- Test accounts validated and functional
- Role-based authorization prevents privilege escalation attacks
