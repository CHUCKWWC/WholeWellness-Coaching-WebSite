Goal
Build an engaging onboarding flow for a mental health/wellness platform that matches or exceeds the client intake quality of BetterHelp and Talkspace. This means a smooth, multi-step guided experience, clear explanations, and real-time feedback. The process should dynamically tailor questions, provide progress visibility, and ensure responsive, accessible UI/UX.

Requirements Overview
User Flow
Stepwise Progression: Multi-page/modal interface, each with a clear focus (e.g., demographics, goals, preferences, consent).

State Persistence: Save user progress at each step (local/session storage or backend).

Dynamic Routing/Branching: Adjust next questions/screens based on prior responses.

Progress Indicator: Visual feedback showing number of steps completed/remaining.

Core Functionalities
Responsive Layout: Ensure mobile and desktop usability.

Form Controls: Multiple choice, checkboxes, text input, sliders, etc.

Validation: Immediate ("onBlur"/"onChange") and on submit—errors must be clear and actionable.

Accessible Markup: All elements (buttons, labels, ARIA tags) must meet accessibility standards.

Key Features from Reference Platforms
Personalization: Starting with open-ended questions or goals.

Psychometric/Lifestyle Assessments: Series of branching questions.

Consent & Privacy: Digital acknowledgment and policy links.

Matching Logic: Final step gives initial “match”^ (dummy data for MVP unless live backend).

CTA Buttons: Clear navigation (“Continue”, “Go Back”, “Submit”, “Restart”).

Technical Implementation Guidance
Interface (Frontend)
Use a robust framework (React, Vue, or similar).

Components are modular and reusable—one per step.

Control navigation with state (e.g., useState, useReducer), or client router for step URLs.

Track form state and updates globally or via context/provider pattern.

Button Action Verification
To verify that all buttons initiate expected actions:

Unit Tests: Write tests (e.g., Jest/React Testing Library) to confirm click/tap on each button:

Advances step ("Continue" triggers route/state update)

Returns to previous step ("Go Back" toggles state)

Submits data and shows loading feedback ("Submit" reveals spinner, disables double submits)

Visual Feedback: Ensure button has a “pressed” state and loading indicator during async ops.

Event Logging: Log all UI actions (console, log system, or mock API) for QA.

Button Verification Sample Pseudocode:

javascript
test('Continue button moves to the next step', () => {
  render(<OnboardingFlow />);
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Continue'));
  expect(screen.getByTestId('step-progress')).toHaveTextContent('Step 2');
});
Backend Integration
Store stepwise answers in session/context and persist to API when done.

Implement endpoint mocks for QA if backend is unavailable.

Include schema example for intake responses.

Accessibility & Compliance
Use semantic HTML and label all inputs/buttons.

Ensure keyboard and screen reader navigation.

Show clear error feedback tied to inputs.

Testing
Unit and Integration Tests: Cover all form logic, validation, and navigational actions.

E2E Tests: Use Cypress or Playwright to simulate complete user flow—including retries, editing, error handling.

Deliverables Checklist
Feature	Requirement	Method of Verification
Multi-step form	Component per step, progress tracker	UI + unit test
Validation	Per-field, per-step, on submit	UI feedback + test
Button Actions	Click triggers correct navigation/state	Unit + E2E test
Responsive design	Mobile/desktop layouts	Media queries + browser QA
Accessibility	ARIA, labeling, tab order	Manual + automated scan
Persistent storage	State saved/restored	Simulated reload QA
Final Notes
Reference BetterHelp and Talkspace onboarding flows for copy, tone, and screen order.

Provide a user experience that's reassuring, frictionless, and confidential.

Ensure that every primary button translates clearly and instantly to an app action, and that such actions are covered by automated tests.

^ For MVP, “matching” may be simulated; in production, hook to a coach/provider database.
