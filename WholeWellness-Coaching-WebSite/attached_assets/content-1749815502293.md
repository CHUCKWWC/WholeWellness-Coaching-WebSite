Our mission is to make high-quality life coaching accessible to all. This is a platform where everyone can find a coach suitable for their goals and needs.

Dasha Lazaryuk

Program Director

​Dasha is a Divorce & Resource (Time, Money, Energy) Coach specializing in helping women reclaim their power amidst a divorce and build their dream life post-divorce. Her goal is to create a support system for women undergoing such a profound transformation. Reflecting on the hardest time of her life, both emotionally and financially, during her own divorce, she wishes she had someone guiding her through the bumpy, rocky road. Back then, she didn't know what she didn't know and had no idea where to seek help. Now, she's excited to be a guide for her clients, raising awareness about the available support, sharing tools & strategies for self-reinvention and managing the most valuable resources the way it makes sense to each woman, and demonstrating ways to reclaim the power within each of us. She considers herself fortunate to wear many hats: being a mom to a teenager, an equestrian, a certified life coach practicing solution-based approach, and a women's advocate.
