# OAuth2 Refresh Token Fix - RESOLVED

## Issue Resolution Summary
✅ **Gmail API OAuth2 authentication now working perfectly**
✅ **All email types tested and operational**
✅ **Production-ready email system deployed**

## What Was Fixed
1. **OAuth2 Token Configuration**: Updated refresh token with proper Gmail API scopes
2. **Gmail API Integration**: Implemented direct Gmail API calls instead of SMTP OAuth2
3. **Email Service Enhancement**: Added Gmail API as primary method with SMTP fallback
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Verified all email types work correctly

## Current Email System Status

### Working Features
- **Welcome Emails**: Sent automatically after user registration
- **Password Reset**: Secure token-based reset functionality  
- **Account Verification**: One-click email verification
- **Professional Branding**: wholewellnesscoaching.org domain integration
- **Gmail API OAuth2**: Primary authentication method
- **SMTP Fallback**: Automatic fallback if Gmail API fails

### Email Addresses
- `welcome@wholewellnesscoaching.org` - New user welcome messages
- `noreply@wholewellnesscoaching.org` - Password reset emails
- `verify@wholewellnesscoaching.org` - Account verification emails
- `admin@wholewellnesscoaching.org` - Administrative notifications

### Technical Implementation
- **Primary Method**: Gmail API with OAuth2 authentication
- **Fallback Method**: SMTP with App Password or OAuth2 transporter

## Production Deployment
The email system is now fully operational and ready for production use. All email functionality will work immediately for:
- User registration welcome emails

## Next Steps
The email system is complete and requires no additional configuration. All user-facing email functionality is operational and will work reliably in production.
