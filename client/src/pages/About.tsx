                <p>
                  Wholewellness Coaching was born from a simple yet powerful observation: 
                  the people who need coaching the most often have the least access to it. 
                  Traditional coaching services, while valuable, remain out of reach for many 
                  due to cost barriers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our founder recognized this gap after witnessing firsthand how life coaching 
                  could transform lives, particularly for women facing major life transitions 
                  such as leaving abusive relationships, navigating divorce, or dealing with 
                  the loss of a spouse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We believe that mental health services are the foundation of self-care, 
                  personal development, and a healthy lifestyle. While therapy helps with 
                  understanding the "why," coaching provides the "how" to apply knowledge 
                  and create meaningful change.
